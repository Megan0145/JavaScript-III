/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window binding: When creating top-level variables, the value of 'this' is the overall window, sort of like the browser 

* 2. Implicit Binding: When calling a method on an object using dot notation, 'this' refers to the specific object preceding the dot. 'This' will vary depending on the context/specific object you are referring to 

* 3. New Binding: When we build constructor functions, 'this' refers to the specific instance of the object being created

* 4. Explicit Binding: We can override the default values of constructor functions properties by explicitly defining 'this' using .call, .apply and .bind
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
